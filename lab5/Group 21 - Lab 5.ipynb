    "Your first goal as a Security Engineer who wants to ensure the security of the application is to identify security vulnerabilities in the project and create testcases to exploit them. In the real world, applications are often tested with test scripts. The following are a few questions a Security Engineer would ask when writing a testcase to test the Security of their application:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Does this application protect the confidentiaility of data?\"\n",
    "* \"Does this application hamper performance?\"\n",
    "* \"Does this application prevent actions that shoudl be allowed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that these questions are parallel to security paradigms: Security, Efficiency and Accuracy, Availability. If you can find a hypothesis where a security paradigm is not met that would mean the application is not secure and a possible exploit exist. The testcases can be written in python or bash."

This is because a vulnerability was discovered in the ‘SampleNetworkClient.py’ part of the application, shown below, which contains a function that passes/stores a hardcoded password value to send it within a message to the Server side socket. Hardcoded credentials generally pose a security risk to an application as an attacker can reverse engineer the code to obtain the password to use elsewhere. In this case an attacker would be able to impersonate/seize the client’s account as their username/password has been exposed. The relevant code has been commented below and a test case has been written in Python/Bash to demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability."

Additionally another vulnerability was discovered in the ‘SampleNetworkClient.py’ & ‘SampleNetworkServer.py’ part of the application, shown below, which contains plaintext authentication tokens, which are values used to identify/track valid logged in user sessions and passes these values between the Client and Server side sockets. Plaintext session tokens jeopardize active sessions within the application as an attacker can easily identify which user/session is running on the system and could potentially terminate a client’s session. This vulnerability also enables a Man-in-the-middle attack, which allows an attacker to obtain an unencrypted token and use it to impersonate and act on behalf of a legitimate user. The relevant code has been commented below and a test case has been written in Python/Bash to demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability."

Also, the system can potentially become unavailable due to a DOS attack aimed at overflowing the list of available tokens or calling the logout procedure with any data (‘SampleNetworkServer.py’) - this is possible due to the fact that the size of the list is not fixed and can be quite large - then the time to search for an invalid token will be equal to the viewing time of all items in the list, which can cause delays in the operation of the server, up to the failure of its operation.
